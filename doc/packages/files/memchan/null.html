<h1> null(n) 2.2  &quot;Memory channels&quot;</h1>
<a name="name"><h2>NAME</h2>
<p> null - Create and manipulate null channels





<a name="synopsis"><h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
package require <b>Tcl</b><br>
package require <b>memchan</b><br>
<br><table border=1 width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr            bgcolor=lightyellow><td bgcolor=lightyellow><table 0 width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr valign=top ><td ><b class='cmd'>null</b> </td></tr>

<a name="description"><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The command described here is only available in a not-yet released
version of the package. Use the CVS to get the sources.

<dl>

<dt><b class='cmd'>null</b> <dd>


creates a null channel which absorbs everything written into
it. Reading from it is not possible, or rather will always return zero
bytes. These channels are essentially Tcl-specific variants of the
null device for unixoid operating systems (/dev/null). Transfering the
generated channel between interpreters is possible but does not make
much sense.

</dl>

<a name="options"><h2>OPTIONS</h2>

Memory channels created by <b class='cmd'>null</b> provide one additional option to
set or query.

<dl>

    <dt><i class='arg'>-delay ?milliseconds?</i><dd>

    A <b class='cmd'>null</b> channel is always writable and readable. This means
    that all <b class='cmd'>fileevent</b>-handlers will fire continuously.  To
    avoid starvation of other event sources the events raised by this
    channel type have a configurable delay. This option is set in
    milliseconds and defaults to 5.

</dl>

<p>

A null channel is always writable and never readable. This means that a
writable <b class='cmd'>fileevent</b>-handler will fire continuously and a readable
<b class='cmd'>fileevent</b>-handler never at all. The exception to the latter is
only the destruction of the channel which will cause the delivery of
an eof event to a readable handler.
