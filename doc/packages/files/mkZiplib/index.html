  <h2><a name="introduction">&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
  <p>
    mkZiplib is essentially a wrapper around the compression libraries Zlib 1.1.3 and Minizip 0.15
    (see the <a href="#notes">notes</a> section below). It provides four new commands that allow
    to compress and decompress data, and to work with .gz (as produced by
    <a href="http://www.gzip.org">gzip</a>) and .zip files.
    mkZiplib makes use of some of Tcl's newer API functions and therefore requires Tcl 8.2 or higher.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="commands">&nbsp;COMMANDS</a></h2>
  <h3>deflate ?-level 0..9? Data</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>deflate</em> command takes Data as a binary string, compresses it,
    and returns the compressed Data as a binary string.
    The <em>-level</em> option influences the compression level and the execution speed.
    It accepts values between 0 (no compression, fast) and 9 (maximum compression, slower).
    For short Data strings, the output from <em>deflate</em> can be longer than the original
    Data, which is due to internal overhead from headers and the way the compression algorithm
    works.
  </p>

  <h3>inflate ?-size numBytes? Data</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>inflate</em> command is the counterpart of <em>deflate</em> and decompresses Data.
    If the size of the <i>uncompressed</i> data is known, then it can be specified with the
    <em>-size</em> option. If not, buffer space is allocated as needed during decompression.
    Using the <em>-size</em> option avoids internal reallocation of memory and can hence
    increase the command's performance.
  </p>

  <h3>gz Option ?args ...?</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>gz</em> command allows to read and write .gz files. This format is common on Unix
    and supported by the command gzip (and gunzip). A gz file contains plain compressed data, but no
    "file directory". It therefore usually represents the compressed version of exactly one file
    (unlike the zip format, which can contain multiple files).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz open ?-level 0..9? GzFileName ?AccessMode?</em><br/>
    For AccessMode <em>r</em> (the default), the file specified by GzFileName is opened for subsequent reading
    operations by means of <em>gz read</em> or <em>gz gets</em>.
    For AccessMode <em>w</em> the file is created, or trunctated if it already exists, for subsequent
    writing operations with <em>gz write</em> or <em>gz flush</em>.
    With AccessMode <em>a</em>, the file is opened for writing, and new data will be appended to it.
    The <em>-level</em> option has the same function as described with the <em>deflate</em> command.
    If successful, the command returns a file handle required for subsequent calls to the <em>gz</em> command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz close GzHandle</em><br/>
    Closes the file identified by GzHandle. If the file was openened for writing, all buffered data
    is automatically flushed prior to closing the file.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz write GzHandle Data</em><br/>
    Compresses and writes Data to the file specified by GzHandle. Data can of course be a binary string.
    Note that the command does not append a newline character to the Data.
    The command returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to the file.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz flush GzHandle</em><br/>
    Flushes any buffered output to the file specified by GzHandle. Similar to the standard Tcl <em>flush</em>
    command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz gets GzHandle</em><br/>
    Reads the next line from the file specified by GzHandle, up to but not including the end-of-line character.
    Similar to the standard Tcl <em>gets</em> command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz read GzHandle ?NumBytes?</em><br/>
    Reads all or <em>NumBytes</em> bytes from the file specified by GzHandle.
    Similar to the standard Tcl <em>read</em> command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz eof GzHandle</em><br/>
    Returns 1 if an end-of-file condition occurred during the most recent operation on the file specified
    by GzHandle, 0 otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>gz handles</em><br/>
    Returns a list with the handles of all currently open gz files.
  </p>

  <h3>zip Option ?args ...?</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>zip</em> command allows to read and write .zip files. This format is common on Windows platforms
    and supported by many tools (FreeZip, pkZip, Winzip, InfoZip and others).
    A zip archive can contain multiple files, which makes the usage of the <em>zip</em> command slightly
    more complicated than that of the <em>gz</em> command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip open ZipFileName ?AccessMode?</em><br/>
    For AccessMode <em>r</em> (the default), the archive specified by ZipFileName is opened for subsequent reading
    operations by means of <em>zip read</em>.
    For AccessMode <em>w</em> the archive is created, or trunctated if it already exists, for subsequent
    writing operations with <em>zip write</em>.
    If successful, the command returns a file handle required for subsequent calls to the <em>zip</em> command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip close ZipHandle</em><br/>
    Closes the archive specified by ZipHandle. If the file was openened for writing, all buffered data
    is automatically flushed prior to closing the file.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip comment ZipHandle ?String?</em><br/>
    Sets or retrieves the comment string of an archive. If String is specified and the archive was opened
    for writing, then String is used as the new comment for the archive (it is actually written during
    <em>gz close</em>). If String is not specified, the archive's comment string is returned, if any.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip set ZipHandle ?FileName? ?options?</em><br/>
    Sets or returns the name of the "current file" within the archive. All calls to <em>zip write</em>,
    <em>zip read</em> and <em>zip eof</em> refer to the current file. The FileName is actually just a
    string and does not have to be the name of an existing file (though it's usually the name and path
    of the file which is about to be zipped).
    If the archive was opened for reading, options are not allowed. If the archive was opened for writing,
    the following options are accepted:<br/>
    <em>-level 0..9</em> defines the compression level and works like in the <em>deflate</em> command.<br/>
    <em>-comment String</em> stores a comment string along with the specified file.<br/>
    <em>-time integer</em> stores the file with a certain timestamp. The option value must be an integer
    as returned by <em>[clock seconds]</em>.<br/>
    <em>-attributes integer</em> stores file attribute flags along with the file. The flags are platform
    specific (sorry, I've got no more information).<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip write GzHandle Data</em><br/>
    Compresses and writes Data to the archive. Data can be a binary string and always
    refers to the "current file" as specified by <em>zip set</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip read GzHandle ?NumBytes?</em><br/>
    Reads all or <em>NumBytes</em> bytes from the file specified by GzHandle.
    Similar to the standard Tcl <em>read</em> command.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip eof GzHandle</em><br/>
    Returns 1 if an end-of-file condition occurred during the most recent operation on the file specified
    by GzHandle, 0 otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip files GzHandle</em><br/>
    Returns a list with the names of the files in the archive.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip info GzHandle FileName</em><br/>
    Returns a list with information about the file specified by FileName. The list consists of five elements:
    The timestamp of the file (as specified during writing with <em>zip set</em>, or -1 if not specified),
    the compressed size of the file, the uncompressed size of the file, the file attributes
    (see <em>zip set</em>), and the file comment (see <em>zip set</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>zip handles</em><br/>
    Returns a list with the handles of all currently open zip archives.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="notes">&nbsp;NOTES</a></h2>

  <h3>Credits</h3>
  <p>
    This extension is based on the great work that was put into
    <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib">Zlib</a> and
    <a href="http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll">Minizip</a>.
    Zlib is a compression library compatible with the gzip format. It is very portable and
    works for virtually any computer hardware and operating system.
    Zlib is written by Jean-Loup Gailly and Mark Adler, and is freely available.
    Minizip, written by Gilles Vollant, is a library for working with zip files. It uses Zlib and is
    included in the Zlib 1.1.3 distribution.
  </p>

  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, it is not possible to append files to a zip archive, nor to delete files from a
    zip archive (the Minizip 1.15 library does not provide functions for that at this time).
  </p>

  <h3>And...</h3>
  <p>
    A more elegant implementation would have been to create a new channel type for gz and zip files
    and do IO operations through regular puts, gets and read commands. If you are looking for something
    like this, check out Andreas Kupries' <a href="http://www.oche.de/~akupries/soft/trf/index.html">
    trf package</a>.

  <h2><a name="installation">&nbsp;INSTALLATION</a></h2>

  <h3>&nbsp;General</h3>
  <p>
    You will need the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib">Zlib 1.1.3</a>
    library to run mkZiplib. For the Windows platform this library (zlib.dll)
    is included in the mkZiplib distribution.
    On Unix it is very easy to build: "./configure && make && make install" is all
    it normally takes.
    The minizip sources (zip.c, zip.h, unzip.c, unzip.h) are part of the Zlib package
    and are also included herein. They are not built as a library but statically linked.
  </p>
  <p>
    mkZiplib is written in C and comes with a DLL for Windows. On Unix, the package needs
    to be compiled into a shared library first (see below). mkZiplib works with Tcl/Tk
    version 8.2 and higher and is stubs-enabled.
  </p>
  <p>
    To install, simply place the directory "mkZiplib1.0" into one of the directories contained in
    the global Tcl variable "auto_path". For a standard Tcl/Tk installation, this is commonly
    "c:/program files/tcl/lib" (Windows) and "/usr/local/lib" (Unix).
  </p>
  <h3>Compiling</h3>
  <p>
    If you don't have Zlib 1.1.3 already in your system (libz.a), then download, compile
    and install it first. All it normally takes is:
  </p>
  <pre>
  ./configure && make && make install</pre>
  <p>
    Next, compile mkZiplib: Provide the correct path to "tcl.h" and link against "tcl83.lib"
    and "zlib.lib" (Windows) or "libtcl83.a" and "libz.a" (Unix) respectively. If you use stubs, define USE_TCL_STUBS and
    link against "tclstub83.lib" (Windows) or "libtclstub83.a" (Unix) instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Visual C++, the following command should work:
  </p>
  <pre>
  cl /I c:/progra~1/tcl/include /D USE_TCL_STUBS /c mkZiplib10.c zip.c unzip.c
  link c:/progra~1/tcl/lib/tclstub83.lib zlib.lib /dll mkZiplib10.obj zip.obj unzip.obj</pre>
  <p>
    On Linux 2.2, this here works fine:
  </p>
  <pre>
  gcc -shared -DUSE_TCL_STUBS -ltclstub8.3 -lz -o mkZiplib10.so mkZiplib10.c zip.c unzip.c</pre>

  <h3>Test</h3>
  <p>
    Test the installation by opening a tclsh or wish and entering "package require mkZiplib".
    The string "1.0" should appear. If it fails, "cd" into the directory "mkZiplib1.0" and
    load it directly with "load ./mkZiplib10.dll" (Windows) or "load ./mkZiplib10.so" (Unix).
    If no error occured, it succeeded and something must be wrong with the location of "mkZiplib1.0".
  </p>
